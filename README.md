## Introduction

The aim of this build was to create a modern, attractive, responsive static site with beautiful animations.

Working on this project helped to solidify my understanding of Styled Components and Framer Motion in React, as well as React Router. I gained experience of designing a website, then faced the challenges of coding it out using ReactJS. Images were sourced from Pexels

## Technologies

This project utilises ReactJS to build a mockup web app. It is a static site with added page animations and uses React-Router to switch pages. Page animations were incorporated using Framer-Motion.

The CSS was typed using Styled Components and the app is split into multiple pages and components for improved organisation and scalability.

#### Versions used:

    React 17.0.1
    jest 5.11.6
    Framer Motion 2.9.4
    React Router DOM 5.2.0
    styled-components 5.2.1

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
